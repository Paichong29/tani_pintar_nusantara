# Source Code Documentation - Tani Pintar Nusantara

## Overview
This document provides guidelines and standards for documenting the source code of the Tani Pintar Nusantara project to ensure maintainability and ease of collaboration.

## 1. Code Comments
- Use DartDoc style comments (`///`) for public classes, methods, and properties.
- Provide clear descriptions of functionality, parameters, and return values.
- Comment complex logic and algorithms for clarity.

## 2. File Organization
- Group related classes and functions into appropriately named files and folders.
- Follow consistent naming conventions for files and classes.

## 3. Naming Conventions
- Use camelCase for variables and methods.
- Use PascalCase for class names.
- Use descriptive and meaningful names.

## 4. Documentation Tools
- Use DartDoc to generate API documentation.
- Keep documentation up to date with code changes.

## 5. Examples
```dart
/// Represents a plant disease analysis result.
/// 
/// Contains details such as disease name, status, confidence score, and recommendations.
class AnalysisResult {
  final String diseaseName;
  final String status;
  final double confidence;
  final String recommendations;

  /// Creates an AnalysisResult instance.
  AnalysisResult(this.diseaseName, this.status, this.confidence, this.recommendations);
}
```

## 6. Best Practices
- Avoid redundant comments.
- Keep comments concise and relevant.
- Review documentation during code reviews.
